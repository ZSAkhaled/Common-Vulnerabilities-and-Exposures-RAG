# CVE-2024-26593 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: i801: Fix block process call transactions

According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block
buffer index twice for block process call transactions: once before
writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
reading the incoming data from the buffer.

The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the wrong
portion of the block buffer to be read.
