# CVE-2024-26760 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: pscsi: Fix bio_put() for error case

As of commit 066ff571011d ("block: turn bio_kmalloc into a simple kmalloc
wrapper"), a bio allocated by bio_kmalloc() must be freed by bio_uninit()
and kfree(). That is not done properly for the error case, hitting WARN and
NULL pointer dereference in bio_free().
