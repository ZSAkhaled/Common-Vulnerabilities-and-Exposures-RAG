# CVE-2024-26884 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches

The hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of
hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the
resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself
can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,
which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which
contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same
fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.
