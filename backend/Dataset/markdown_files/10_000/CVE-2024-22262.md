# CVE-2024-22262 - security@vmware.com

Applications that use UriComponentsBuilder to parse an externally provided URL (e.g. through a query parameter) AND perform validation checks on the host of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to a  open redirect https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html  attack or to a SSRF attack if the URL is used after passing validation checks.

This is the same as  CVE-2024-22259 https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22259  and  CVE-2024-22243 https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22243 , but with different input.
