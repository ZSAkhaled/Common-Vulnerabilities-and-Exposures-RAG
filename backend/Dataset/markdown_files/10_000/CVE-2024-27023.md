# CVE-2024-27023 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: Fix missing release of 'active_io' for flush

submit_flushes
 atomic_set(&mddev->flush_pending, 1);
 rdev_for_each_rcu(rdev, mddev)
  atomic_inc(&mddev->flush_pending);
  bi->bi_end_io = md_end_flush
  submit_bio(bi);
                        /* flush io is done first */
                        md_end_flush
                         if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))
                          percpu_ref_put(&mddev->active_io)
                          -> active_io is not released

 if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))
  -> missing release of active_io

For consequence, mddev_suspend() will wait for 'active_io' to be zero
forever.

Fix this problem by releasing 'active_io' in submit_flushes() if
'flush_pending' is decreased to zero.
