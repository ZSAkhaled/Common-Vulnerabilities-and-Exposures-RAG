# CVE-2024-32478 - security-advisories@github.com

Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper. Prior to 2.5.0, the Debian package does not set root ownership on installed files. This allows user 1001 on a multi-user system can replace binary and gain other users' privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.0.
