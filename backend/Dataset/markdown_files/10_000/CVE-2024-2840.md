# CVE-2024-2840 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Enhanced Media Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via media upload functionality in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.9 due to the plugin allowing 'dfxp' files to be uploaded. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
