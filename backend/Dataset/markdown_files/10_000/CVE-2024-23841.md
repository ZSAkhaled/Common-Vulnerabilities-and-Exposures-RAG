# CVE-2024-23841 - security-advisories@github.com

apollo-client-nextjs is the Apollo Client support for the Next.js App Router. The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to either inject malicious input (e.g. by redirecting a user to a specifically-crafted link) or arrange to have malicious input be returned by a GraphQL server (e.g. by persisting it in a database). To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.
