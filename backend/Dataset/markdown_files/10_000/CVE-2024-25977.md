# CVE-2024-25977 - security-research@sec-consult.com

The application does not change the session token when using the login or logout functionality. An attacker can set a session token in the victim's browser (e.g. via XSS) and prompt the victim to log in (e.g. via a redirect to the login page). This results in the victim's account being taken over.
