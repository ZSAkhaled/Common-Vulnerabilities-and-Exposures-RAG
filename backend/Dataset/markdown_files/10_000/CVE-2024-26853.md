# CVE-2024-26853 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: avoid returning frame twice in XDP_REDIRECT

When a frame can not be transmitted in XDP_REDIRECT
(e.g. due to a full queue), it is necessary to free
it by calling xdp_return_frame_rx_napi.

However, this is the responsibility of the caller of
the ndo_xdp_xmit (see for example bq_xmit_all in
kernel/bpf/devmap.c) and thus calling it inside
igc_xdp_xmit (which is the ndo_xdp_xmit of the igc
driver) as well will lead to memory corruption.

In fact, bq_xmit_all expects that it can return all
frames after the last successfully transmitted one.
Therefore, break for the first not transmitted frame,
but do not call xdp_return_frame_rx_napi in igc_xdp_xmit.
This is equally implemented in other Intel drivers
such as the igb.

There are two alternatives to this that were rejected:
1. Return num_frames as all the frames would have been
   transmitted and release them inside igc_xdp_xmit.
   While it might work technically, it is not what
   the return value is meant to represent (i.e. the
   number of SUCCESSFULLY transmitted packets).
2. Rework kernel/bpf/devmap.c and all drivers to
   support non-consecutively dropped packets.
   Besides being complex, it likely has a negative
   performance impact without a significant gain
   since it is anyway unlikely that the next frame
   can be transmitted if the previous one was dropped.

The memory corruption can be reproduced with
the following script which leads to a kernel panic
after a few seconds.  It basically generates more
traffic than a i225 NIC can transmit and pushes it
via XDP_REDIRECT from a virtual interface to the
physical interface where frames get dropped.
