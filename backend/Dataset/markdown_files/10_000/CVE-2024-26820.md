# CVE-2024-26820 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missed

If hv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTER
handler cannot perform VF register successfully as the register call
is received before netvsc_probe is finished. This is because we
register register_netdevice_notifier() very early( even before
vmbus_driver_register()).
To fix this, we try to register each such matching VF( if it is visible
as a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.
