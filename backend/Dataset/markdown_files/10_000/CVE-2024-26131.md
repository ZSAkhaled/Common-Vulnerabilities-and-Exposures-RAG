# CVE-2024-26131 - security-advisories@github.com

Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. Element Android version 1.4.3 through 1.6.10 is vulnerable to intent redirection, allowing a third-party malicious application to start any internal activity by passing some extra parameters. Possible impact includes making Element Android display an arbitrary web page, executing arbitrary JavaScript; bypassing PIN code protection; and account takeover by spawning a login screen to send credentials to an arbitrary home server. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.
