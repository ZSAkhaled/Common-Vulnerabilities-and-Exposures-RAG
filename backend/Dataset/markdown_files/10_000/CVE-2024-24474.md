# CVE-2024-24474 - cve@mitre.org

QEMU before 8.2.0 has an integer underflow, and resultant buffer overflow, via a TI command when an expected non-DMA transfer length is less than the length of the available FIFO data. This occurs in esp_do_nodma in hw/scsi/esp.c because of an underflow of async_len.
