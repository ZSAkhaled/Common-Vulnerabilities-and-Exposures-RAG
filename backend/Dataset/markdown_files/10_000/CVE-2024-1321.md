# CVE-2024-1321 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The EventPrime â€“ Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This is due to the plugin allowing unauthenticated users to update the status of order payments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to book events for free.
