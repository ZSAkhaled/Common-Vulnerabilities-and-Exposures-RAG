# CVE-2024-2313 - security@ubuntu.com

If kernel headers need to be extracted, bpftrace will attempt to load them from a temporary directory. An unprivileged attacker could use this to force bcc to load compromised linux headers. Linux distributions which provide kernel headers by default are not affected by default.
