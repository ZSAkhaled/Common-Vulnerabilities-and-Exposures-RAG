# CVE-2024-26708 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: really cope with fastopen race

Fastopen and PM-trigger subflow shutdown can race, as reported by
syzkaller.

In my first attempt to close such race, I missed the fact that
the subflow status can change again before the subflow_state_change
callback is invoked.

Address the issue additionally copying with all the states directly
reachable from TCP_FIN_WAIT1.
