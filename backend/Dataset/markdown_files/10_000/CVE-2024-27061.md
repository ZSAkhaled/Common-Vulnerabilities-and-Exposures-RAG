# CVE-2024-27061 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unprepare

sun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare should be called before
crypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacks may
immediately free memory, that isn't needed anymore. But it will be
used by unprepare after free. Before removing prepare/unprepare
callbacks it was handled by crypto engine in crypto_finalize_request.

Usually that results in a pointer dereference problem during a in
crypto selftest.
 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
