# CVE-2024-26806 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks

The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not
expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().
Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.

Those helpers have two roles currently:
 - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.
 - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It
   requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.

Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two
however has two implications:
 - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context
   where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where
   the usage count is incremented).
 - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.

Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:

spi_mem_exec_op()
        ...
        spi_mem_access_start()
                mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)

        cqspi_exec_mem_op()
                pm_runtime_resume_and_get()
                        cqspi_resume()
                                spi_controller_resume()
                                        mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)
                ...

        spi_mem_access_end()
                mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)
        ...
