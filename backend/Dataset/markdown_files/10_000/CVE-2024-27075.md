# CVE-2024-27075 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-frontends: avoid stack overflow warnings with clang

A previous patch worked around a KASAN issue in stv0367, now a similar
problem showed up with clang:

drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv0367.c:1222:12: error: stack frame size (3624) exceeds limit (2048) in 'stv0367ter_set_frontend' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than]
 1214 | static int stv0367ter_set_frontend(struct dvb_frontend *fe)

Rework the stv0367_writereg() function to be simpler and mark both
register access functions as noinline_for_stack so the temporary
i2c_msg structures do not get duplicated on the stack when KASAN_STACK
is enabled.
