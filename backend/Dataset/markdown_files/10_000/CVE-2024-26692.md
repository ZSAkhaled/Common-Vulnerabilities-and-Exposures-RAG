# CVE-2024-26692 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: Fix regression in writes when non-standard maximum write size negotiated

The conversion to netfs in the 6.3 kernel caused a regression when
maximum write size is set by the server to an unexpected value which is
not a multiple of 4096 (similarly if the user overrides the maximum
write size by setting mount parm "wsize", but sets it to a value that
is not a multiple of 4096).  When negotiated write size is not a
multiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final
page when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.

This section of code is being rewritten/removed due to a large
netfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kernel until now)
we can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.

Add a warning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not
a multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add a change where we
round down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value
that is not a multiple of 4096 (we also have to check to make sure that
we do not round it down to zero).
