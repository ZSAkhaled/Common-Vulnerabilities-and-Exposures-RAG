# CVE-2024-26660 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN301

'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers
structures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding
to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that
there is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is
out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior

Here, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If
eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the
stream_enc_regs array.

Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn301_stream_encoder_create
reported by Smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn301/dcn301_resource.c:1011 dcn301_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5
