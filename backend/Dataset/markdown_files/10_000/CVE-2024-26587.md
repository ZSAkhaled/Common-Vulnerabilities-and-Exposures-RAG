# CVE-2024-26587 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs

PHC gets initialized in nsim_init_netdevsim(), which
is only called if (nsim_dev_port_is_pf()).

Create a counterpart of nsim_init_netdevsim() and
move the mock_phc_destroy() there.

This fixes a crash trying to destroy netdevsim with
VFs instantiated, as caught by running the devlink.sh test:
