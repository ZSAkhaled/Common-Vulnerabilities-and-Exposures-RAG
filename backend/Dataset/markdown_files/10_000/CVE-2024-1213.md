# CVE-2024-1213 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Easy Social Feed – Social Photos Gallery – Post Feed – Like Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the esf_insta_save_access_token and efbl_save_facebook_access_token functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to connect their facebook and instagram pages to the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
