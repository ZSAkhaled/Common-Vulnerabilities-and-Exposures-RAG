# CVE-2024-0853 - cve@curl.se

curl inadvertently kept the SSL session ID for connections in its cache even when the verify status (*OCSP stapling*) test failed. A subsequent transfer to
the same hostname could then succeed if the session ID cache was still fresh, which then skipped the verify status check.
