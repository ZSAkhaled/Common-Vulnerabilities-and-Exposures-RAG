# CVE-2024-26917 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: Revert "scsi: fcoe: Fix potential deadlock on &fip->ctlr_lock"

This reverts commit 1a1975551943f681772720f639ff42fbaa746212.

This commit causes interrupts to be lost for FCoE devices, since it changed
sping locks from "bh" to "irqsave".

Instead, a work queue should be used, and will be addressed in a separate
commit.
