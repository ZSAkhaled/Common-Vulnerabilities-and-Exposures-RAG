# CVE-2024-3020 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to and including, 2.6.3 via deserialization of untrusted input in the import function via the 'shortcode' parameter. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
