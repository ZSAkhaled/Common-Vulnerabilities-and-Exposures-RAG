# CVE-2024-26758 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery()

mddev_suspend() never stop sync_thread, hence it doesn't make sense to
ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery(), which might cause
sync_thread can't be unregistered.

After commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread"), following
hang can be triggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh:

1) suspend the array:
raid_postsuspend
 mddev_suspend

2) stop the array:
raid_dtr
 md_stop
  __md_stop_writes
   stop_sync_thread
    set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR, &mddev->recovery);
    md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);
    wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery))

3) sync thread done:
md_do_sync
 set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);
 md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread);

4) daemon thread can't unregister sync thread:
md_check_recovery
 if (mddev->suspended)
   return; -> return directly
 md_read_sync_thread
 clear_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery);
 -> MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 2 hang;

This problem is not just related to dm-raid, fix it by ignoring
suspended array in md_check_recovery(). And follow up patches will
improve dm-raid better to frozen sync thread during suspend.
