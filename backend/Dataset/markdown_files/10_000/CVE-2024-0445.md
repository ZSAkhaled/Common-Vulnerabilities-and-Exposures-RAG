# CVE-2024-0445 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's element attributes in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. CVE-2024-34373 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
