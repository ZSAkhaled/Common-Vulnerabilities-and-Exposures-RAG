# CVE-2024-26694 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bug

The storage for the TLV PC register data wasn't done like all
the other storage in the drv->fw area, which is cleared at the
end of deallocation. Therefore, the freeing must also be done
differently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, since
otherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails
to load after this has been parsed, and we get another free
later (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by adding
the missing NULL assignment.
