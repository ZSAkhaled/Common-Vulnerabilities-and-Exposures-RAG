# CVE-2024-27418 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: take ownership of skb in mctp_local_output

Currently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of skb on success, and
we may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the
skb ownership isn't transferred until the actual output routing occurs.

Instead, make mctp_local_output free the skb on all error paths up to
the route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.
