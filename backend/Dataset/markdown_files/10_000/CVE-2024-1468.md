# CVE-2024-1468 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax_import_options() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
