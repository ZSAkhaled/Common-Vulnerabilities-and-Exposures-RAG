# CVE-2024-21617 - sirt@juniper.net


An Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Nonstop active routing (NSR) component of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause memory leak leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS platforms, when NSR is enabled, a BGP flap will cause memory leak. A manual reboot of the system will restore the services.

Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.
The memory usage can be monitored using the below commands.

user@host> show chassis routing-engine no-forwarding
user@host> show system memory | no-more
