# CVE-2024-27037 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: zynq: Prevent null pointer dereference caused by kmalloc failure

The kmalloc() in zynq_clk_setup() will return null if the
physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use snprintf()
to write data to the null address, the null pointer dereference
bug will happen.

This patch uses a stack variable to replace the kmalloc().
