# CVE-2024-22421 - security-advisories@github.com

JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Users of JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.
