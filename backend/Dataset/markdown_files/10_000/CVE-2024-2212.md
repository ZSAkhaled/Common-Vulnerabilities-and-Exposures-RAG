# CVE-2024-2212 - security@eclipse.org

In Eclipse ThreadX before 6.4.0,  xQueueCreate() and xQueueCreateSet() 
functions from the FreeRTOS compatibility API 
(utility/rtos_compatibility_layers/FreeRTOS/tx_freertos.c) were missing 
parameter checks. This could lead to integer wraparound, 
under-allocations and heap buffer overflows.
