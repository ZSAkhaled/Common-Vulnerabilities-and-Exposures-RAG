# CVE-2024-26912 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks

Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects.  Several of
these buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocated
right after GSP-RM is initialized, but the rest need to stay until the
driver unloads.

Also futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and
clearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoning
the buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries
to access the buffer after we've deallocated it, because we were wrong
about when it is safe to deallocate.

Finally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that's the same
type that dma_alloc_coherent expects.
