# CVE-2024-0380 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 9.1.0 via the 'icon' attribute used in Shortcodes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include the contents of SVG files on the server, which can be leveraged for Cross-Site Scripting.
