# CVE-2024-26848 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix endless loop in directory parsing

If a directory has a block with only ".__afsXXXX" files in it (from
uncompleted silly-rename), these .__afsXXXX files are skipped but without
advancing the file position in the dir_context.  This leads to
afs_dir_iterate() repeating the block again and again.

Fix this by making the code that skips the .__afsXXXX file also manually
advance the file position.

The symptoms are a soft lookup:

This is almost certainly the actual fix for:
