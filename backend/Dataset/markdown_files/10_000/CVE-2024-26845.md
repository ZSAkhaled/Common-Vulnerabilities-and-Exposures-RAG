# CVE-2024-26845 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: core: Add TMF to tmr_list handling

An abort that is responded to by iSCSI itself is added to tmr_list but does
not go to target core. A LUN_RESET that goes through tmr_list takes a
refcounter on the abort and waits for completion. However, the abort will
be never complete because it was not started in target core.

 Unable to locate RefTaskTag: 0x05000000 on CID: 0.

To fix this, only add abort to tmr_list if it will be handled by target
core.
