# CVE-2024-24478 - cve@mitre.org

An issue in Wireshark before 4.2.0 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via the packet-bgp.c, dissect_bgp_open(tvbuff_t*tvb, proto_tree*tree, packet_info*pinfo), optlen components. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because neither release 4.2.0 nor any other release was affected.
