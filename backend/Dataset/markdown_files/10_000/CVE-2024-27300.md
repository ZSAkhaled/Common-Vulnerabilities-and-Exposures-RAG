# CVE-2024-27300 - security-advisories@github.com

phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. The `email` field in phpMyFAQ's user control panel page is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks due to the inadequacy of PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` function, which only validates the email format, not its content. This vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary client-side JavaScript within the context of another user's phpMyFAQ session. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.
