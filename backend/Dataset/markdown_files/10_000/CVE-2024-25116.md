# CVE-2024-25116 - security-advisories@github.com

RedisBloom adds a set of probabilistic data structures to Redis. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.7 and 2.6.10, authenticated users can use the `CF.RESERVE` command to trigger a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. The problem is fixed in RedisBloom 2.4.7 and 2.6.10.
