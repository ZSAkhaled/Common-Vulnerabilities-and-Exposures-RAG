# CVE-2024-26988 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

init/main.c: Fix potential static_command_line memory overflow

We allocate memory of size 'xlen + strlen(boot_command_line) + 1' for
static_command_line, but the strings copied into static_command_line are
extra_command_line and command_line, rather than extra_command_line and
boot_command_line.

When strlen(command_line) > strlen(boot_command_line), static_command_line
will overflow.

This patch just recovers strlen(command_line) which was miss-consolidated
with strlen(boot_command_line) in the commit f5c7310ac73e ("init/main: add
checks for the return value of memblock_alloc*()")
