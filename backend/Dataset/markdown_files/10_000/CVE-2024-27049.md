# CVE-2024-27049 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7925e: fix use-after-free in free_irq()

From commit a304e1b82808 ("[PATCH] Debug shared irqs"), there is a test
to make sure the shared irq handler should be able to handle the unexpected
event after deregistration. For this case, let's apply MT76_REMOVED flag to
indicate the device was removed and do not run into the resource access
anymore.
