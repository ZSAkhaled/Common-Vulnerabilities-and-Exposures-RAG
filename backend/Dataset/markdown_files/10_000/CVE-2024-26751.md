# CVE-2024-26751 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: ep93xx: Add terminator to gpiod_lookup_table

Without the terminator, if a con_id is passed to gpio_find() that
does not exist in the lookup table the function will not stop looping
correctly, and eventually cause an oops.
