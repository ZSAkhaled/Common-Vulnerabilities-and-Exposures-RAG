# CVE-2024-2619 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Elementor Header & Footer Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.26 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary HTML in pages that will be shown whenever a user accesses an injected page.
