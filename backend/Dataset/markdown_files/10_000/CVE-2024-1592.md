# CVE-2024-1592 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Complianz â€“ GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_delete function in class-DNSMPD.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete GDPR data requests via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
