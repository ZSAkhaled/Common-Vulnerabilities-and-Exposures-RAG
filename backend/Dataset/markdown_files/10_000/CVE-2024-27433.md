# CVE-2024-27433 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: mediatek: mt7622-apmixedsys: Fix an error handling path in clk_mt8135_apmixed_probe()

'clk_data' is allocated with mtk_devm_alloc_clk_data(). So calling
mtk_free_clk_data() explicitly in the remove function would lead to a
double-free.

Remove the redundant call.
