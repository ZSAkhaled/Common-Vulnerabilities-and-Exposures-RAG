# CVE-2024-26621 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit

commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP
boundaries") caused two issues [1] [2] reported on 32 bit system or compat
userspace.

It doesn't make too much sense to force huge page alignment on 32 bit
system due to the constrained virtual address space.
