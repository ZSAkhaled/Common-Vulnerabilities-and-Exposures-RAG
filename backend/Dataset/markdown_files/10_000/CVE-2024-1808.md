# CVE-2024-1808 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The WP Shortcodes Plugin â€” Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'su_qrcode' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
