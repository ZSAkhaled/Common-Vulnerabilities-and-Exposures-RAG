# CVE-2024-27923 - security-advisories@github.com

Grav is a content management system (CMS). Prior to version 1.7.43, users who may write a page may use the `frontmatter` feature due to insufficient permission validation and inadequate file name validation. This may lead to remote code execution. Version 1.7.43 fixes this issue.
