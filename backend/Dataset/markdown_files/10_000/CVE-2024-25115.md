# CVE-2024-25115 - security-advisories@github.com

RedisBloom adds a set of probabilistic data structures to Redis. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.7 and 2.6.10, specially crafted `CF.LOADCHUNK` commands may be used by authenticated users to perform heap overflow, which may lead to remote code execution. The problem is fixed in RedisBloom 2.4.7 and 2.6.10.
