# CVE-2024-21611 - sirt@juniper.net


A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

In a Juniper Flow Monitoring (jflow) scenario route churn that causes BGP next hops to be updated will cause a slow memory leak and eventually a crash and restart of rpd.

Thread level memory utilization for the areas where the leak occurs can be checked using the below command:

user@host> show task memory detail | match so_in
so_in6 28 32 344450 11022400 344760 11032320
so_in 8 16 1841629 29466064 1841734 29467744
