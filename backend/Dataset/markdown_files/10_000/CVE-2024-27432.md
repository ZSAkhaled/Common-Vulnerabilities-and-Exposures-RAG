# CVE-2024-27432 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue

A patch to resolve an issue was found in MediaTek's GPL-licensed SDK:
In the mtk_ppe_stop() function, the PPE scan mode is not disabled before
disabling the PPE. This can potentially lead to a hang during the process
of disabling the PPE.

Without this patch, the PPE may experience a hang during the reboot test.
