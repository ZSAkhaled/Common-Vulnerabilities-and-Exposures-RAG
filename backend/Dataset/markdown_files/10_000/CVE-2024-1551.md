# CVE-2024-1551 - security@mozilla.org

Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8.
