# CVE-2024-0789 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The WP Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.9.2 due to insufficient IP address validation and use of user-supplied HTTP headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass maintenance mode.
