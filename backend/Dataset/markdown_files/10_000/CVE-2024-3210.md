# CVE-2024-3210 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Paid Membership Plugin, Ecommerce, User Registration Form, Login Form, User Profile & Restrict Content â€“ ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'reg-single-checkbox' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
