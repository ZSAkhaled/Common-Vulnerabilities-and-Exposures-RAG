# CVE-2024-27043 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free

In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed
in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL
after dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,
for example, in the following call chain:

budget_register
  |-> dvb_dmxdev_init
        |-> dvb_register_device
  |-> dvb_dmxdev_release
        |-> dvb_unregister_device
              |-> dvb_remove_device
                    |-> dvb_device_put
                          |-> kref_put

When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in
dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in
dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to
kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.
