# CVE-2024-3071 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The ACF On-The-Go plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the acfg_update_fields() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary post titles, descriptions, and ACF values.
