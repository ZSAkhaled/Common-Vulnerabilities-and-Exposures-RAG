# CVE-2024-28191 - security-advisories@github.com

Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character.
