# CVE-2024-26828 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()

In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check
if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,
the problem is that "bytes_left" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type
size_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is
done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop
continues instead of ending.
