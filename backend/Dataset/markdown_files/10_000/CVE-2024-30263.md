# CVE-2024-30263 - security-advisories@github.com

macro-pdfviewer is a PDF Viewer Macro for XWiki using Mozilla pdf.js. Users with edit rights can access restricted PDF attachments using the PDF Viewer macro, just by passing the attachment URL as the value of the ``file`` parameter.

This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.1.
