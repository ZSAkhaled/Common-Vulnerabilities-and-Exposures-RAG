# CVE-2024-22859 - cve@mitre.org

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in livewire before v3.0.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code getCsrfToken function. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the 5d88731 commit fixes a usability problem (HTTP 419 status codes for legitimate client activity), not a security problem.
