# CVE-2024-26668 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_limit: reject configurations that cause integer overflow

Reject bogus configs where internal token counter wraps around.
This only occurs with very very large requests, such as 17gbyte/s.

Its better to reject this rather than having incorrect ratelimit.
