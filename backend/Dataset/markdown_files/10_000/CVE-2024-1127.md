# CVE-2024-1127 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The EventPrime â€“ Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the booking_export_all() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve all event booking which can contain PII.
