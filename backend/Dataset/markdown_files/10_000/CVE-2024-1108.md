# CVE-2024-1108 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Plugin Groups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the admin_init() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the settings of the plugin, which can also cause a denial of service due to a misconfiguration.
