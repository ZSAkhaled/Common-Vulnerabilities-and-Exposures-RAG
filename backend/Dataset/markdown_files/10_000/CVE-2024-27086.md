# CVE-2024-27086 - security-advisories@github.com

The MSAL library enabled acquisition of security tokens to call protected APIs. MSAL.NET applications targeting Xamarin Android and .NET Android (e.g., MAUI) using the library from versions 4.48.0 to 4.60.0 are impacted by a low severity vulnerability.   
A malicious application running on a customer Android device    can cause local denial of service against applications that were built using MSAL.NET for authentication on the same device (i.e., prevent the user of the legitimate application from logging in) due to incorrect activity export configuration. MSAL.NET version 4.60.1 includes the fix.  As a workaround, a developer may explicitly mark the MSAL.NET activity non-exported.
