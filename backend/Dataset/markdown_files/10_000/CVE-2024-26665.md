# CVE-2024-26665 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tunnels: fix out of bounds access when building IPv6 PMTU error

If the ICMPv6 error is built from a non-linear skb we get the following
splat,

  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in do_csum+0x220/0x240

Use skb_checksum instead of csum_partial who cannot deal with non-linear
SKBs.
