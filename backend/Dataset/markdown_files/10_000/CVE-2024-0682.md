# CVE-2024-0682 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Page Restrict plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.5. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to posts via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view protected posts.
