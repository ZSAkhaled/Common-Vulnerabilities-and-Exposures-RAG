# CVE-2024-23650 - security-advisories@github.com

BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. A malicious BuildKit client or frontend could craft a request that could lead to BuildKit daemon crashing with a panic. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5. As a workaround, avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.
