# CVE-2024-28234 - security-advisories@github.com

Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject CSS styles via BBCode in comments. Installations are only affected if BBCode is enabled. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable BBCode for comments.
