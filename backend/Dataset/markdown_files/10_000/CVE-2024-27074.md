# CVE-2024-27074 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: go7007: fix a memleak in go7007_load_encoder

In go7007_load_encoder, bounce(i.e. go->boot_fw), is allocated without
a deallocation thereafter. After the following call chain:

saa7134_go7007_init
  |-> go7007_boot_encoder
        |-> go7007_load_encoder
  |-> kfree(go)

go is freed and thus bounce is leaked.
