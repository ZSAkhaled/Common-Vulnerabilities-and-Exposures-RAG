The Real Media Library: Media Library Folder & File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the image title and alt text in all versions up to, and including, 4.22.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
