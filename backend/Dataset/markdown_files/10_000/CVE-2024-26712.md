# CVE-2024-26712 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/kasan: Fix addr error caused by page alignment

In kasan_init_region, when k_start is not page aligned, at the begin of
for loop, k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK is less than k_start, and then
`va = block + k_cur - k_start` is less than block, the addr va is invalid,
because the memory address space from va to block is not alloced by
memblock_alloc, which will not be reserved by memblock_reserve later, it
will be used by other places.

As a result, memory overwriting occurs.

for example:
int __init __weak kasan_init_region(void *start, size_t size)
{
[...]
	/* if say block(dcd97000) k_start(feef7400) k_end(feeff3fe) */
	block = memblock_alloc(k_end - k_start, PAGE_SIZE);
	[...]
	for (k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK; k_cur < k_end; k_cur += PAGE_SIZE) {
		/* at the begin of for loop
		 * block(dcd97000) va(dcd96c00) k_cur(feef7000) k_start(feef7400)
		 * va(dcd96c00) is less than block(dcd97000), va is invalid
		 */
		void *va = block + k_cur - k_start;
		[...]
	}
[...]
}

Therefore, page alignment is performed on k_start before
memblock_alloc() to ensure the validity of the VA address.
