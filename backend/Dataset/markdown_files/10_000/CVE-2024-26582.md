# CVE-2024-26582 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt

tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb,
so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger
a use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the
partially-read skb.
