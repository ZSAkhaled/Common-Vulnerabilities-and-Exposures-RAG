# CVE-2024-27302 - security-advisories@github.com

go-zero is a web and rpc framework. Go-zero allows user to specify a CORS Filter with a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy. However, the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass via a malicious domain. This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing any page to make requests and/or retrieve data on behalf of other users. Version 1.4.4 fixes this issue.
