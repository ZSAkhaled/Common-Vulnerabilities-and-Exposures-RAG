# CVE-2024-28865 - security-advisories@github.com

django-wiki is a wiki system for Django. Installations of django-wiki prior to version 0.10.1 are vulnerable to maliciously crafted article content that can cause severe use of server CPU through a regular expression loop. Version 0.10.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, close off access to create and edit articles by anonymous users.
