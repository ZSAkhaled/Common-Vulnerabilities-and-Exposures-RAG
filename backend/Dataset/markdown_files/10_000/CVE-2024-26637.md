# CVE-2024-26637 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: rely on mac80211 debugfs handling for vif

mac80211 started to delete debugfs entries in certain cases, causing a
ath11k to crash when it tried to delete the entries later. Fix this by
relying on mac80211 to delete the entries when appropriate and adding
them from the vif_add_debugfs handler.
