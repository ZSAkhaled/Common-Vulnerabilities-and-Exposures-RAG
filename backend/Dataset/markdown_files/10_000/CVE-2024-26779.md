# CVE-2024-26779 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit

fast-xmit must only be enabled after the sta has been uploaded to the driver,
otherwise it could end up passing the not-yet-uploaded sta via drv_tx calls
to the driver, leading to potential crashes because of uninitialized drv_priv
data.
Add a missing sta->uploaded check and re-check fast xmit after inserting a sta.
