# CVE-2024-2970 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The News Wall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the nwap_newslist_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and modify news lists via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
