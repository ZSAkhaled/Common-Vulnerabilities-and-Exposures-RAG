# CVE-2024-21614 - sirt@juniper.net


An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause rpd to crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when NETCONF and gRPC are enabled, and a specific query is executed via Dynamic Rendering (DREND), rpd will crash and restart. Continuous execution of this specific query will cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue affects:

  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R2-S2, 22.2R3;
  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2, 22.3R3.
