# CVE-2024-26698 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove

In commit ac5047671758 ("hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
VMBus channel"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.

This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
netvsc_subchan_work did not run.

netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
opposite.

Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.

This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
for cleanup purpose.
