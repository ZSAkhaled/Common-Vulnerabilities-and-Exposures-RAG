# CVE-2024-1763 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Wp Social Login and Register Social Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the /wp_social/v1/ REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable and disable certain providers for the social share and login features.
