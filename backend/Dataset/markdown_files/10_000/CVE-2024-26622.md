# CVE-2024-26622 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head->write_buf when write()
of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head->write_buf after
head->io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can
cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.
