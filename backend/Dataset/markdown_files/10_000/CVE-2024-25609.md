# CVE-2024-25609 - security@liferay.com

HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect in Liferay Portal 7.2.0 through 7.4.3.12, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 9, 7.3 service pack 3, 7.2 fix pack 15 through 18, and older unsupported versions can be circumvented by using two forward slashes, which allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs via the (1) 'redirect` parameter (2) `FORWARD_URL` parameter, and (3) others parameters that rely on HtmlUtil.escapeRedirect. This vulnerability is the result of an incomplete fix in CVE-2022-28977.
