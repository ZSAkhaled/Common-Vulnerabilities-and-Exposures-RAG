# CVE-2024-27417 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix potential "struct net" leak in inet6_rtm_getaddr()

It seems that if userspace provides a correct IFA_TARGET_NETNSID value
but no IFA_ADDRESS and IFA_LOCAL attributes, inet6_rtm_getaddr()
returns -EINVAL with an elevated "struct net" refcount.
