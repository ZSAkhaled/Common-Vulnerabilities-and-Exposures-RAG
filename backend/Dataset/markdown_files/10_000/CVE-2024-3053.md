# CVE-2024-3053 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Forminator – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘id’ forminator_form shortcode attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.29.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
