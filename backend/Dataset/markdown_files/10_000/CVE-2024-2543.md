# CVE-2024-2543 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'get_uri_editor' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view the permalinks of all posts.
