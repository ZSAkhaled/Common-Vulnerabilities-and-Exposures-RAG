# CVE-2024-27048 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcm80211: handle pmk_op allocation failure

The kzalloc() in brcmf_pmksa_v3_op() will return null if the
physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
the null value, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.

Return -ENOMEM from brcmf_pmksa_v3_op() if kzalloc() fails
for pmk_op.
