# CVE-2024-1073 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The SlimStat Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'filter_array' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
