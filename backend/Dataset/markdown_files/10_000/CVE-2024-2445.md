# CVE-2024-2445 - responsibledisclosure@mattermost.com

Mattermost Jira plugin versions shipped with Mattermost versions 8.1.x before 8.1.10, 9.2.x before 9.2.6, 9.3.x before 9.3.2, and 9.4.x before 9.4.3 fail to escape user-controlled outputs when generating HTML pages, which allows an attacker to perform reflected cross-site scripting attacks against the users of the Mattermost server.
