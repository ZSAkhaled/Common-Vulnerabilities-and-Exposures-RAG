# CVE-2024-1398 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Ultimate Bootstrap Elements for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘heading_title_tag’ and ’heading_sub_title_tag’ parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
