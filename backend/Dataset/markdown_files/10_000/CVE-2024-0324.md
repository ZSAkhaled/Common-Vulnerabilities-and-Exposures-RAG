# CVE-2024-0324 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The User Profile Builder â€“ Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wppb_two_factor_authentication_settings_update' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable the 2FA functionality present in the Premium version of the plugin for arbitrary user roles.
