# CVE-2024-26855 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ice: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ice_bridge_setlink()

The function ice_bridge_setlink() may encounter a NULL pointer dereference
if nlmsg_find_attr() returns NULL and br_spec is dereferenced subsequently
in nla_for_each_nested(). To address this issue, add a check to ensure that
br_spec is not NULL before proceeding with the nested attribute iteration.
