# CVE-2024-21594 - sirt@juniper.net


A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Network Services Daemon (NSD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows authenticated, low privileged, local attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On an SRX 5000 Series device, when executing a specific command repeatedly, memory is corrupted, which leads to a Flow Processing Daemon (flowd) crash.

The NSD process has to be restarted to restore services.

If this issue occurs, it can be checked with the following command:

user@host> request security policies check
The following log message can also be observed:

Error: policies are out of sync for PFE node<number>.fpc<number>.pic<number>.
