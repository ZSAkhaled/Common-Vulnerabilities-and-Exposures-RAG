# CVE-2024-27032 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid potential panic during recovery

During recovery, if FAULT_BLOCK is on, it is possible that
f2fs_reserve_new_block() will return -ENOSPC during recovery,
then it may trigger panic.

Also, if fault injection rate is 1 and only FAULT_BLOCK fault
type is on, it may encounter deadloop in loop of block reservation.

Let's change as below to fix these issues:
- remove bug_on() to avoid panic.
- limit the loop count of block reservation to avoid potential
deadloop.
