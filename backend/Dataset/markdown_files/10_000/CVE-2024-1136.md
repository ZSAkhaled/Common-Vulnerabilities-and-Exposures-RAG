# CVE-2024-1136 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to an improperly implemented URL check in the wpsm_coming_soon_redirect function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view a site with maintenance mode or coming-soon mode enabled to view the site's content.
