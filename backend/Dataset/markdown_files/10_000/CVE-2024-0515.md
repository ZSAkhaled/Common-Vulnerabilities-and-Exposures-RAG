# CVE-2024-0515 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.87. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the remove_from_compare function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove items from user compare lists via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
