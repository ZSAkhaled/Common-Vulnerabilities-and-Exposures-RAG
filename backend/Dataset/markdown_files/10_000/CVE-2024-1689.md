The WooCommerce Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the woocommerce_tool_toggle_module() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to deactivate arbitrary plugin modules.
