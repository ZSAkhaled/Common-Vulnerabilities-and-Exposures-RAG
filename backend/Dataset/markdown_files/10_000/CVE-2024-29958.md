# CVE-2024-29958 - sirt@brocade.com

A vulnerability in Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a prints the encryption key in the console when a privileged user executes the script to replace the Brocade SANnav Management Portal standby node. This could provide attackers an additional, less protected path to acquiring the encryption key.
