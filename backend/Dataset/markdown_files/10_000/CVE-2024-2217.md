# CVE-2024-2217 - security@huntr.dev

gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to the `config.json` file. This vulnerability is present in both authenticated and unauthenticated versions of the application, enabling attackers to obtain sensitive information such as API keys (`openai_api_key`, `google_palm_api_key`, `xmchat_api_key`, etc.), configuration details, and user credentials. The issue stems from the application's handling of HTTP requests for the `config.json` file, which does not properly restrict access based on user authentication.
