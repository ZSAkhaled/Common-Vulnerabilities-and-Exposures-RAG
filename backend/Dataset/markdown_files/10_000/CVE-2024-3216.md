The WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wt_pklist_reset_settings() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset all of the plugin's settings.
