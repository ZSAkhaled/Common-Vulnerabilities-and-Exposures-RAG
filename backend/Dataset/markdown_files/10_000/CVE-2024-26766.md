# CVE-2024-26766 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix sdma.h tx->num_descs off-by-one error

Unfortunately the commit `fd8958efe877` introduced another error
causing the `descs` array to overflow. This reults in further crashes
easily reproducible by `sendmsg` system call.

If an SDMA send consists of exactly 6 descriptors and requires dword
padding (in the 7th descriptor), the sdma_txreq descriptor array is not
properly expanded and the packet will overflow into the container
structure. This results in a panic when the send completion runs. The
exact panic varies depending on what elements of the container structure
get corrupted. The fix is to use the correct expression in
_pad_sdma_tx_descs() to test the need to expand the descriptor array.

With this patch the crashes are no longer reproducible and the machine is
stable.
