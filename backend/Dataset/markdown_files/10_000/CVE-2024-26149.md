# CVE-2024-26149 - security-advisories@github.com

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.
