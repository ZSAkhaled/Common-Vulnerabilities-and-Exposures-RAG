# CVE-2024-26654 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
 ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                 |    mod_timer()
  flush_work()                   |
  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
  kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker
  ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE

In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.
