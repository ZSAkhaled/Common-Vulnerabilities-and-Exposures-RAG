# CVE-2024-1491 - ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov

The devices allow access to an unprotected endpoint that allows MPFS 
file system binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2 file 
system module provides a light-weight read-only file system that can be 
stored in external EEPROM, external serial flash, or internal flash 
program memory. This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web 
server module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to 
other applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. 
This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds 
the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.
