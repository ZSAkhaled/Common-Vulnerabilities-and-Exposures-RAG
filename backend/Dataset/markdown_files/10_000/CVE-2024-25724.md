In RTI Connext Professional 5.3.1 through 6.1.0 before 6.1.1, a buffer overflow in XML parsing from Routing Service, Recording Service, Queuing Service, and Cloud Discovery Service allows attackers to execute code with the affected service's privileges, compromise the service's integrity, leak sensitive information, or crash the service. These attacks could be done via a remote malicious RTPS message; a compromised call with malicious parameters to the RTI_RoutingService_new, rti::recording::Service, RTI_QueuingService_new, or RTI_CDS_Service_new public APIs; or a compromised local file system containing a malicious XML file.
