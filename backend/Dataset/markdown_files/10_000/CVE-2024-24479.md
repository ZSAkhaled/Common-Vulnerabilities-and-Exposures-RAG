# CVE-2024-24479 - cve@mitre.org

A Buffer Overflow in Wireshark before 4.2.0 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via the wsutil/to_str.c, and format_fractional_part_nsecs components. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because neither release 4.2.0 nor any other release was affected.
