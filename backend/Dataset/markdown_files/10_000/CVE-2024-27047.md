# CVE-2024-27047 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: fix phy_get_internal_delay accessing an empty array

The phy_get_internal_delay function could try to access to an empty
array in the case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delay
without defining delay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps or
tx-internal-delay-ps is defined to 0 in the device-tree.
This will lead to "unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
virtual address 0". To avoid this kernel oops, the test should be delay
>= 0. As there is already delay < 0 test just before, the test could
only be size == 0.
