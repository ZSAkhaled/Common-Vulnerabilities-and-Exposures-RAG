In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/aio: Restrict kiocb_set_cancel_fn() to I/O submitted via libaio

If kiocb_set_cancel_fn() is called for I/O submitted via io_uring, the
following kernel warning appears:

WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 368 at fs/aio.c:598 kiocb_set_cancel_fn+0x9c/0xa8

Fix this by setting the IOCB_AIO_RW flag for read and write I/O that is
submitted by libaio.
