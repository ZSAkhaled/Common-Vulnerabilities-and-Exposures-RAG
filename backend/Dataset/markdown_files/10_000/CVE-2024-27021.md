# CVE-2024-27021 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal

Binding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic
because on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this
by avoiding the device-managed LED functions.

Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even
if registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects
this and is a no-op in this case.
