# CVE-2024-2476 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the load_theme_panel_pane function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information such as system/environment data and API keys.
