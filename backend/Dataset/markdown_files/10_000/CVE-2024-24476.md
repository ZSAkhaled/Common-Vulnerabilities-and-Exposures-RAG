# CVE-2024-24476 - cve@mitre.org

A buffer overflow in Wireshark before 4.2.0 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via the pan/addr_resolv.c, and ws_manuf_lookup_str(), size components. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because neither release 4.2.0 nor any other release was affected.
