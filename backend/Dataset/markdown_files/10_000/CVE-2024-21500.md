# CVE-2024-21500 - report@snyk.io

All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts via the two-factor authentication (2FA). Although the application blocks the user after several failed attempts to provide 2FA codes, attackers can bypass this blocking mechanism by automating the applicationâ€™s full multistep 2FA process.
