# CVE-2024-21639 - security-advisories@github.com

CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework ) is a simple framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications. `CefLayeredWindowUpdaterOSR::OnAllocatedSharedMemory` does not check the size of the shared memory, which leads to out-of-bounds read outside the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in commit 1f55d2e.
