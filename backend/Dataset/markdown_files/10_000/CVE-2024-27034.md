# CVE-2024-27034 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix to cover normal cluster write with cp_rwsem

When we overwrite compressed cluster w/ normal cluster, we should
not unlock cp_rwsem during f2fs_write_raw_pages(), otherwise data
will be corrupted if partial blocks were persisted before CP & SPOR,
due to cluster metadata wasn't updated atomically.
