# CVE-2024-1567 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'file_validity' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.94. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload dangerous file types such as .svgz on the affected site's server which may make cross-site scripting or remote code execution possible.
