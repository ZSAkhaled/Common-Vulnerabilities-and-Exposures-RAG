# CVE-2024-1729 - security@huntr.dev

A timing attack vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically within the login function in routes.py. The vulnerability arises from the use of a direct comparison operation (`app.auth[username] == password`) to validate user credentials, which can be exploited to guess passwords based on response times. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
