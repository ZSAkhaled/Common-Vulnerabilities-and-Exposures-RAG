# CVE-2024-27392 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()

When nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct
nvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()
for the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in
KASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with
proposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by
skipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.
