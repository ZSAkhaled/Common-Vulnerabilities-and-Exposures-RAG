# CVE-2024-30407 - sirt@juniper.net

The Use of a Hard-coded Cryptographic Key vulnerability in Juniper Networks Juniper Cloud Native Router (JCNR) and containerized routing Protocol Deamon (cRPD) products allows an attacker to perform Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) attacks which results in complete compromise of the container. 

Due to hardcoded SSH host keys being present on the container, a PitM attacker can intercept SSH traffic without being detected. 

This issue affects Juniper Networks JCNR:
  *  All versions before 23.4.


This issue affects Juniper Networks cRPD:
  *  All versions before 23.4R1.
