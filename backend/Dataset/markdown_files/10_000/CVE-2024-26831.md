# CVE-2024-26831 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1

Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:

Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but
    handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000
    req == 0000000060f99b40
not ok 11 req_destroy works

This is because "sock_release(sock)" was replaced with "fput(filp)"
to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.

The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed
but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy
method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the
final close is complete before it checks the pointer.

We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never
called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.
