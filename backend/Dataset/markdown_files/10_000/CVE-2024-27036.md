# CVE-2024-27036 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix writeback data corruption

cifs writeback doesn't correctly handle the case where
cifs_extend_writeback() hits a point where it is considering an additional
folio, but this would overrun the wsize - at which point it drops out of
the xarray scanning loop and calls xas_pause().  The problem is that
xas_pause() advances the loop counter - thereby skipping that page.

What needs to happen is for xas_reset() to be called any time we decide we
don't want to process the page we're looking at, but rather send the
request we are building and start a new one.

Fix this by copying and adapting the netfslib writepages code as a
temporary measure, with cifs writeback intending to be offloaded to
netfslib in the near future.

This also fixes the issue with the use of filemap_get_folios_tag() causing
retry of a bunch of pages which the extender already dealt with.

This can be tested by creating, say, a 64K file somewhere not on cifs
(otherwise copy-offload may get underfoot), mounting a cifs share with a
wsize of 64000, copying the file to it and then comparing the original file
and the copy:

        dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/64K bs=64k count=1
        mount //192.168.6.1/test /mnt -o user=...,pass=...,wsize=64000
        cp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K
        cmp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K

Without the fix, the cmp fails at position 64000 (or shortly thereafter).
