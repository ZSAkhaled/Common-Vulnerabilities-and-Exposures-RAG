# CVE-2024-1288 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'saswp_reviews_form_render' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify the plugin's stored reCaptcha site and secret keys, potentially breaking the reCaptcha functionality.
