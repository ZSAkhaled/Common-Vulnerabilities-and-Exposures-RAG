# CVE-2024-26839 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix a memleak in init_credit_return

When dma_alloc_coherent fails to allocate dd->cr_base[i].va,
init_credit_return should deallocate dd->cr_base and
dd->cr_base[i] that allocated before. Or those resources
would be never freed and a memleak is triggered.
