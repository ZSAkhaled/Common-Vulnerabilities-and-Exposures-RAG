# CVE-2024-1550 - security@mozilla.org

A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8.
