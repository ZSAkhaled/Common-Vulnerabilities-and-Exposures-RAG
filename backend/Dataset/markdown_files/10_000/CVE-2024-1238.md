# CVE-2024-1238 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the button ID parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
