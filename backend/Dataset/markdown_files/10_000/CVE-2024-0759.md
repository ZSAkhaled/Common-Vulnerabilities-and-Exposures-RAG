# CVE-2024-0759 - security@huntr.dev

Should an instance of AnythingLLM be hosted on an internal network and the attacked be explicitly granted a permission level of manager or admin, they could link-scrape internally resolving IPs of other services that are on the same network as AnythingLLM.

This would require the attacker also be able to guess these internal IPs as `/*` ranging is not possible, but could be brute forced.

There is a duty of care that other services on the same network would not be fully open and accessible via a simple CuRL with zero authentication as it is not possible to set headers or access via the link collector.
