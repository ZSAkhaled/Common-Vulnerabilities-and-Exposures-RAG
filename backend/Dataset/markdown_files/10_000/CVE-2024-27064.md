# CVE-2024-27064 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: Fix a memory leak in nf_tables_updchain

If nft_netdev_register_hooks() fails, the memory associated with
nft_stats is not freed, causing a memory leak.

This patch fixes it by moving nft_stats_alloc() down after
nft_netdev_register_hooks() succeeds.
