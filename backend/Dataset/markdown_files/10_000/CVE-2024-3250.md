# CVE-2024-3250 - security@ubuntu.com

It was discovered that Canonical's Pebble service manager read-file API and the associated pebble pull command, before v1.10.2, allowed unprivileged local users to read files with root-equivalent permissions when Pebble was running as root. Fixes are also available as backports to v1.1.1, v1.4.2, and v1.7.4.
