# CVE-2024-1476 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Under Construction / Maintenance Mode from Acurax plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.6 via the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the contents of posts and pages when maintenance mode is active thus bypassing the protection provided by the plugin.
