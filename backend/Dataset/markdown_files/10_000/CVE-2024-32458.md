# CVE-2024-32458 - security-advisories@github.com

FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. FreeRDP based clients that use a version of FreeRDP prior to 3.5.0 or 2.11.6 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. Versions 3.5.0 and 2.11.6 patch the issue. As a workaround, use `/gfx` or `/rfx` modes (on by default, require server side support).
