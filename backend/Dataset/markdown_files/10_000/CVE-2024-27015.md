# CVE-2024-27015 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable: incorrect pppoe tuple

pppoe traffic reaching ingress path does not match the flowtable entry
because the pppoe header is expected to be at the network header offset.
This bug causes a mismatch in the flow table lookup, so pppoe packets
enter the classical forwarding path.
