The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the openai_file_list_callback function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to list files existing in a linked OpenAI account.
