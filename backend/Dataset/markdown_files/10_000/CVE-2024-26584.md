# CVE-2024-26584 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests

Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our
requests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return
 -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when
the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an
artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued
to the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback
will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it
seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.

Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to
EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling
paths. The handling is identical.
