# CVE-2024-2539 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via widget '_id' attributes in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
