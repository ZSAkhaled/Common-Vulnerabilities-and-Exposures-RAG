# CVE-2024-26717 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: i2c-hid-of: fix NULL-deref on failed power up

A while back the I2C HID implementation was split in an ACPI and OF
part, but the new OF driver never initialises the client pointer which
is dereferenced on power-up failures.
