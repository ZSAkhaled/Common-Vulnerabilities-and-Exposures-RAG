# CVE-2024-26814 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger

The eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is
initially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the trigger
eventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that
trigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), but
the loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function
need to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths
both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.

The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does it
support any sort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pci
and vfio-platform, the flow can remain essentially unchanged.
