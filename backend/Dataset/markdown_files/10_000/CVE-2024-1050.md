# CVE-2024-1050 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Import and export users and customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_force_reset_password_delete_metas() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.26.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete all forced password resets.
