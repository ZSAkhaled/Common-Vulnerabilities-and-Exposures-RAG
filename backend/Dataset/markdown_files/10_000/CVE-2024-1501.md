# CVE-2024-1501 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Database Reset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.22. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the install_wpr() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install the WP Reset Plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
