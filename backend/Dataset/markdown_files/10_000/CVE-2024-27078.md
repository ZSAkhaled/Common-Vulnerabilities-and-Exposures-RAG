# CVE-2024-27078 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-tpg: fix some memleaks in tpg_alloc

In tpg_alloc, resources should be deallocated in each and every
error-handling paths, since they are allocated in for statements.
Otherwise there would be memleaks because tpg_free is called only when
tpg_alloc return 0.
