# CVE-2024-0213 - trellixpsirt@trellix.com


A buffer overflow vulnerability in TA for Linux and TA for MacOS prior to 5.8.1 allows a local user to gain elevated permissions, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS), through exploiting a memory corruption issue in the TA service, which runs as root. This may also result in the disabling of event reporting to ePO, caused by failure to validate input from the file correctly.
