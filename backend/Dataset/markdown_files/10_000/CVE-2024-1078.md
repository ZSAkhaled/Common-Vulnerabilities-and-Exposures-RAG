The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ays_quick_start() and add_question_rows() functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary quizzes.
