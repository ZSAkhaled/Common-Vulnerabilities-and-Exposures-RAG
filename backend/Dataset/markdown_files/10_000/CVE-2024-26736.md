# CVE-2024-26736 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Increase buffer size in afs_update_volume_status()

The max length of volume->vid value is 20 characters.
So increase idbuf[] size up to 24 to avoid overflow.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

[DH: Actually, it's 20 + NUL, so increase it to 24 and use snprintf()]
