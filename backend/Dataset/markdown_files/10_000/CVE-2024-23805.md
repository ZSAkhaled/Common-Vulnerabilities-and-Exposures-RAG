# CVE-2024-23805 - f5sirt@f5.com


Undisclosed requests can cause the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate. For the Application Visibility and Reporting module, this may occur when the HTTP Analytics profile with URLs enabled under Collected Entities is configured on a virtual server and the DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI or avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are enabled. For BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM, this may occur when either a DoS or Bot Defense profile is configured on a virtual server and the DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI or avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are enabled.

Note: The DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI and avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are not enabled by default. For more information about the HTTP Analytics profile and the Collect URLs setting, refer to  K30875743: Create a new Analytics profile and attach it to your virtual servers https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K30875743 .
