# CVE-2024-26809 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: release elements in clone only from destroy path

Clone already always provides a current view of the lookup table, use it
to destroy the set, otherwise it is possible to destroy elements twice.

This fix requires:

 212ed75dc5fb ("netfilter: nf_tables: integrate pipapo into commit protocol")

which came after:

 9827a0e6e23b ("netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: release elements in clone from abort path").
