Dell SCG, versions prior to 5.24.00.00, contain an Improper Access Control vulnerability in the SCG exposed for an internal maintenance REST API (if enabled by Admin user from UI). A remote low privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of certain APIs applicable only for Admin Users on the application's backend database that could potentially allow an unauthorized user access to restricted resources and change of state.
