# CVE-2024-30382 - sirt@juniper.net

An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to send a specific routing update, causing an rpd core due to memory corruption, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

This issue can only be triggered when the system is configured for CoS-based forwarding (CBF) with a policy map containing a cos-next-hop-map action (see below).

Junos OS: 


  *  all versions before 20.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S8,
  *  from 21.3 before 21.3R3, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3, 
  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R2;
