# CVE-2024-29883 - security-advisories@github.com

CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting & creating wikis. Suppression of wiki requests does not work as intended, and always restricts visibility to those with the `(createwiki)` user right regardless of the settings one sets on a given wiki request. This may expose information to users who are not supposed to be able to access it.
