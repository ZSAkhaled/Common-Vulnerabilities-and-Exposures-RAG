# CVE-2024-27001 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: vmk80xx: fix incomplete endpoint checking

While vmk80xx does have endpoint checking implemented, some things
can fall through the cracks. Depending on the hardware model,
URBs can have either bulk or interrupt type, and current version
of vmk80xx_find_usb_endpoints() function does not take that fully
into account. While this warning does not seem to be too harmful,
at the very least it will crash systems with 'panic_on_warn' set on
them.

Fix the issue found by Syzkaller [1] by somewhat simplifying the
endpoint checking process with usb_find_common_endpoints() and
ensuring that only expected endpoint types are present.

This patch has not been tested on real hardware.
