# CVE-2024-1942 - responsibledisclosure@mattermost.com

Mattermost versions 8.1.x before 8.1.9, 9.2.x before 9.2.5, and 9.3.0 fail to sanitize the metadata on posts containing permalinks under specific conditions, which allows an authenticated attacker to access the contents of individual posts in channels they are not a member of.
