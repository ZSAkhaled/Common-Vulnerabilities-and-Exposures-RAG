# CVE-2024-23078 - cve@mitre.org

JGraphT Core v1.5.2 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.jgrapht.alg.util.ToleranceDoubleComparator::compare(Double, Double). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.
