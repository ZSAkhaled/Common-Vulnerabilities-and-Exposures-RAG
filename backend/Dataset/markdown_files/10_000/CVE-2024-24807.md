Sulu is a highly extensible open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework. There is an issue when inputting HTML into the Tag name. The HTML is executed when the tag name is listed in the auto complete form. Only admin users can create tags so they are the only ones affected. The problem is patched with version(s) 2.4.16 and 2.5.12.
