# CVE-2024-22233 - security@vmware.com

In Spring Framework versions 6.0.15 and 6.1.2, it is possible for a user to provide specially crafted HTTP requests that may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:

  *  the application uses Spring MVC
  *  Spring Security 6.1.6+ or 6.2.1+ is on the classpath


Typically, Spring Boot applications need the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web and org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security dependencies to meet all conditions.
