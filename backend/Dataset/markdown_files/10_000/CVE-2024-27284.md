# CVE-2024-27284 - security-advisories@github.com

cassandra-rs is a Cassandra (CQL) driver for Rust. Code that attempts to use an item (e.g., a row) returned by an iterator after the iterator has advanced to the next item will be accessing freed memory and experience undefined behaviour.  The problem has been fixed in version 3.0.0.
