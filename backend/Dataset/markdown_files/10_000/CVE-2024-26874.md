# CVE-2024-26874 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip

It's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL in
mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().

pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but in
mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same
lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.

Consider the following case:

CPU1                              CPU2
step 1:
mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()
mtk_crtc->event is not null,
                                  step 1:
                                  mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:
                                  mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(
                                      !!mtk_crtc->event)
step 2:
mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
mtk_drm_finish_page_flip:
lock
mtk_crtc->event set to null,
pending_needs_vblank set to false
unlock
                                  pending_needs_vblank set to true,

                                  step 2:
                                  mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
                                  mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,
                                  pending_needs_vblank is still true
                                  //null pointer

Instead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more
efficient to just check if mtk_crtc->event is null before use.
