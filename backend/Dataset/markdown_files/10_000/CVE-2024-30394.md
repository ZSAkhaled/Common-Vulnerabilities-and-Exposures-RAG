# CVE-2024-30394 - sirt@juniper.net

AÂ Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) component of Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an rpd crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when EVPN is configured, and a specific EVPN type-5 route is received via BGP, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of this specific route will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue affects:
Junos OS:



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S7,

  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5,

  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4,

  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2,

  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S1,

  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,

  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2.





Junos OS Evolved:



  *  all versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO,

  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,

  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S2-EVO,

  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S1-EVO,

  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,

  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.
