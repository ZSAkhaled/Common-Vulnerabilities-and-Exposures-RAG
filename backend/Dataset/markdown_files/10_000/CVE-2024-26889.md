# CVE-2024-26889 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow

struct hci_dev_info has a fixed size name[8] field so in the event that
hdev->name is bigger than that strcpy would attempt to write past its
size, so this fixes this problem by switching to use strscpy.
