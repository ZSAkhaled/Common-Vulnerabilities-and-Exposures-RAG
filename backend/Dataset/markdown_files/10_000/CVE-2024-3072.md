# CVE-2024-3072 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The ACF Front End Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the update_texts() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary post title, content, and ACF data.
