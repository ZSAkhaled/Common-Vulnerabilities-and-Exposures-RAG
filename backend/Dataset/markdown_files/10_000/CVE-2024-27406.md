# CVE-2024-27406 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/Kconfig.debug: TEST_IOV_ITER depends on MMU

Trying to run the iov_iter unit test on a nommu system such as the qemu
kc705-nommu emulation results in a crash.

    KTAP version 1
    # Subtest: iov_iter
    # module: kunit_iov_iter
    1..9
BUG: failure at mm/nommu.c:318/vmap()!
Kernel panic - not syncing: BUG!

The test calls vmap() directly, but vmap() is not supported on nommu
systems, causing the crash.  TEST_IOV_ITER therefore needs to depend on
MMU.
