# CVE-2024-26600 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: ti: phy-omap-usb2: Fix NULL pointer dereference for SRP

If the external phy working together with phy-omap-usb2 does not implement
send_srp(), we may still attempt to call it. This can happen on an idle
Ethernet gadget triggering a wakeup for example:

configfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: ECM Suspend
configfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: Port suspended. Triggering wakeup
...

udp_sendmsg from __sys_sendto+0xd8/0x158
__sys_sendto from ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x58

Let's fix the issue by checking for send_srp() and set_vbus() before
calling them. For USB peripheral only cases these both could be NULL.
