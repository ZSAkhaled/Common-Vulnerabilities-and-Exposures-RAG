# CVE-2024-26795 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Sparse-Memory/vmemmap out-of-bounds fix

Offset vmemmap so that the first page of vmemmap will be mapped
to the first page of physical memory in order to ensure that
vmemmapâ€™s bounds will be respected during
pfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() operations.
The conversion macros will produce correct SV39/48/57 addresses
for every possible/valid DRAM_BASE inside the physical memory limits.
