# CVE-2024-1124 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The EventPrime â€“ Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized email sending due to a missing capability check on the ep_send_attendees_email() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to send arbitrary emails with arbitrary content from the site.
