# CVE-2024-27003 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary

Similar to the previous commit, we should make sure that all devices are
runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure
to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device
to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another
thread, e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting
up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this path
because they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime
resumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value of
clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked, leading to an RPM count underflow
on error paths.
