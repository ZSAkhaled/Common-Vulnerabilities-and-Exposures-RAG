# CVE-2024-30398 - sirt@juniper.net

An Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a high amount of specific traffic is received on a SRX4600 device, due to an error in internal packet handling, a consistent rise in CPU memory utilization occurs. This results in packet drops in the traffic and eventually the PFE crashes. A manual reboot of the PFE will be required to restore the device to original state.

This issue affects Junos OS:  


  *  21.2 before 21.2R3-S7,
  *  21.4 before 21.4R3-S6, 
  *  22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, 
  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,
  *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,
  *  22.4 before 22.4R3,

  *  23.2 before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.
