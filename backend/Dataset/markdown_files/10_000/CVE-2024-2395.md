# CVE-2024-2395 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Bulgarisation for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and delete labels via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
