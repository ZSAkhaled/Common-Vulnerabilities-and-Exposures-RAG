# CVE-2024-2839 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'colibri_post_title' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.263 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'heading_type'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
