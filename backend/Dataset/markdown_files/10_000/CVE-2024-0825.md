The Vimeography: Vimeo Video Gallery WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 via deserialization of untrusted input via the vimeography_duplicate_gallery_serialized in the duplicate_gallery function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
