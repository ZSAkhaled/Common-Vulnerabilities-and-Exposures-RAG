# CVE-2024-30381 - sirt@juniper.net

An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center allows a network-adjacent attacker with root access to a Test Agent Appliance the ability to access sensitive information about downstream devices.

The "netrounds-probe-login" daemon (also called probe_serviced) exposes functions where the Test Agent (TA) Appliance pushes interface state/config, unregister itself, etc.  The remote service accidentally exposes an internal database object that can be used for direct database access on the Paragon Active Assurance Control Center.




This issue affects Paragon Active Assurance: 4.1.0, 4.2.0.
