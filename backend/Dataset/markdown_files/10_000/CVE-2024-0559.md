# CVE-2024-0559 - contact@wpscan.com

The Enhanced Text Widget WordPress plugin before 1.6.6 does not validate and escape some of its Widget options before outputting them back in attributes, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
