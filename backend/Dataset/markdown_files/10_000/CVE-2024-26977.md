# CVE-2024-26977 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pci_iounmap(): Fix MMIO mapping leak

The #ifdef ARCH_HAS_GENERIC_IOPORT_MAP accidentally also guards iounmap(),
which means MMIO mappings are leaked.

Move the guard so we call iounmap() for MMIO mappings.
