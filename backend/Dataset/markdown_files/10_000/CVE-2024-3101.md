# CVE-2024-3101 - security@huntr.dev

In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access.
