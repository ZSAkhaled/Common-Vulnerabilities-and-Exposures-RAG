# CVE-2024-26591 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix re-attachment branch in bpf_tracing_prog_attach

The following case can cause a crash due to missing attach_btf:

1) load rawtp program
2) load fentry program with rawtp as target_fd
3) create tracing link for fentry program with target_fd = 0
4) repeat 3

In the end we have:

- prog->aux->dst_trampoline == NULL
- tgt_prog == NULL (because we did not provide target_fd to link_create)
- prog->aux->attach_btf == NULL (the program was loaded with attach_prog_fd=X)
- the program was loaded for tgt_prog but we have no way to find out which one

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058
