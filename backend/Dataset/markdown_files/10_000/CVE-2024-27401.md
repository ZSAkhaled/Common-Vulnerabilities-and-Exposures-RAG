# CVE-2024-27401 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents

Ensure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If
the length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get
will now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read
and a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.
