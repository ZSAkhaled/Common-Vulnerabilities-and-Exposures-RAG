# CVE-2024-26784 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: arm: Fix NULL dereference on scmi_perf_domain removal

On unloading of the scmi_perf_domain module got the below splat, when in
the DT provided to the system under test the '#power-domain-cells' property
was missing. Indeed, this particular setup causes the probe to bail out
early without giving any error, which leads to the ->remove() callback gets
to run too, but without all the expected initialized structures in place.

Add a check and bail out early on remove too.
