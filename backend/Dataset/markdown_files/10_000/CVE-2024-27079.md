# CVE-2024-27079 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix NULL domain on device release

In the kdump kernel, the IOMMU operates in deferred_attach mode. In this
mode, info->domain may not yet be assigned by the time the release_device
function is called. It leads to the following crash in the crash kernel:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000003c
    ...
    RIP: 0010:do_raw_spin_lock+0xa/0xa0

    ...
    i801_probe+0x423/0x740

Use the release_domain mechanism to fix it. The scalable mode context
entry which is not part of release domain should be cleared in
release_device().
