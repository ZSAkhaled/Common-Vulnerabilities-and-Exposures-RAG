# CVE-2024-27435 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation

We found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,
admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.
After dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag
allocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request
waiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the
request maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As
fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we
need a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held
by keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we
failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I
think we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.
