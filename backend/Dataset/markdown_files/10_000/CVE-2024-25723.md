# CVE-2024-25723 - cve@mitre.org

ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.
