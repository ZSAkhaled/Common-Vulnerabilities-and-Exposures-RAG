# CVE-2024-23746 - cve@mitre.org

Miro Desktop 0.8.18 on macOS allows local Electron code injection via a complex series of steps that might be usable in some environments (bypass a kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppBundles requirement via a file copy, an app.app/Contents rename, an asar modification, and a rename back to app.app/Contents).
