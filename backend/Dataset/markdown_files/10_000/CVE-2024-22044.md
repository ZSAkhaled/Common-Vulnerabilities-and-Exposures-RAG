# CVE-2024-22044 - productcert@siemens.com

A vulnerability has been identified in SENTRON 3KC ATC6 Expansion Module Ethernet (3KC9000-8TL75) (All versions). Affected devices expose an unused, unstable http service at port 80/tcp on the Modbus-TCP Ethernet. This could allow an attacker on the same Modbus network to create a denial of service condition that forces the device to reboot.
