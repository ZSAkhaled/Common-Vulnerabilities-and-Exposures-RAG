# CVE-2024-26872 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setup

Upon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write
in srpt_refresh_port().

This seems to be because an event handler is registered before the
srpt device is fully setup and a race condition upon error may leave a
partially setup event handler in place.

Instead, only register the event handler after srpt device initialization
is complete.
