# CVE-2024-1385 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The WP-Stateless â€“ Google Cloud Storage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the dismiss_notices() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary option values to the current time, which may completely take a site offline.
