# CVE-2024-28868 - security-advisories@github.com

Umbraco is an ASP.NET content management system. Umbraco 10 prior to 10.8.4 with access to the native login screen is vulnerable to a possible user enumeration attack. This issue was fixed in version 10.8.5. As a workaround, one may disable the native login screen by exclusively using external logins.
