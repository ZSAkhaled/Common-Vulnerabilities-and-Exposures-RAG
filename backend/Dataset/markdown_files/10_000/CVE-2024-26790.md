# CVE-2024-26790 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read

There is chip (ls1028a) errata:

The SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read transactions by QDMA.

Unaligned read transactions initiated by QDMA may stall in the NOC
(Network On-Chip), causing a deadlock condition. Stalled transactions will
trigger completion timeouts in PCIe controller.

Workaround:
Enable prefetch by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit
( SD[PF] = 1 ).

Implement this workaround.
