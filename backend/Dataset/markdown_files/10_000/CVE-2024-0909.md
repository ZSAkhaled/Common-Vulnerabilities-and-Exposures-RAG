# CVE-2024-0909 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Anonymous Restricted Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This is due to insufficient restrictions through the REST API on the posts/pages that protections are being place on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access protected content.
