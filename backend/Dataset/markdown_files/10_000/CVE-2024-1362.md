# CVE-2024-1362 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.253. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the cp_shortcode_refresh() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
