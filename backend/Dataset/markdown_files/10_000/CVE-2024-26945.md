# CVE-2024-26945 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: iaa - Fix nr_cpus < nr_iaa case

If nr_cpus < nr_iaa, the calculated cpus_per_iaa will be 0, which
causes a divide-by-0 in rebalance_wq_table().

Make sure cpus_per_iaa is 1 in that case, and also in the nr_iaa == 0
case, even though cpus_per_iaa is never used if nr_iaa == 0, for
paranoia.
