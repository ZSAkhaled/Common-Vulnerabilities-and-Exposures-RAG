# CVE-2024-2969 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The WP-Eggdrop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpegg_updateOptions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
