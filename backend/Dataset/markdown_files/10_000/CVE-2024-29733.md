# CVE-2024-29733 - security@apache.org

Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP Provider.

The FTP hook lacks complete certificate validation in FTP_TLS connections, which can potentially be leveraged. Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.

This issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.
