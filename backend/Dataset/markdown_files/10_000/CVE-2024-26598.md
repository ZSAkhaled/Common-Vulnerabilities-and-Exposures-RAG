# CVE-2024-26598 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache

There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation
cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such
as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq
before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.

Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq
and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.
