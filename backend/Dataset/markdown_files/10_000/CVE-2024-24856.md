# CVE-2024-24856 - security@openanolis.org

The memory allocation function ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED does not guarantee a
successful allocation, but the subsequent code directly dereferences the
pointer that receives it, which may lead to null pointer dereference.

To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null, 
return exception code AE_NO_MEMORY.
