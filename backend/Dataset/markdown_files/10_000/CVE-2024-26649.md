# CVE-2024-26649 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix the null pointer when load rlc firmware

If the RLC firmware is invalid because of wrong header size,
the pointer to the rlc firmware is released in function
amdgpu_ucode_request. There will be a null pointer error
in subsequent use. So skip validation to fix it.
