# CVE-2024-26616 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: scrub: avoid use-after-free when chunk length is not 64K aligned

[BUG]
There is a bug report that, on a ext4-converted btrfs, scrub leads to
various problems, including:

- "unable to find chunk map" errors
  BTRFS info (device vdb): scrub: started on devid 1
  BTRFS critical (device vdb): unable to find chunk map for logical 2214744064 length 4096
  BTRFS critical (device vdb): unable to find chunk map for logical 2214744064 length 45056

  This would lead to unrepariable errors.

- Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free

[CAUSE]
The converted fs has the following data chunk layout:

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single

For above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end
(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).

This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio
function for both of the two halves.

However scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function
to be called once, not any more.
This means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,
leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to
use-after-free.

[FIX]
- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range
  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not
  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.

- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range
  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to
  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.

Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:

- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()
  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,
  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read
  beyond the chunk.
