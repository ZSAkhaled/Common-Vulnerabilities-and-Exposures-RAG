# CVE-2024-26714 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: qcom: sc8180x: Mark CO0 BCM keepalive

The CO0 BCM needs to be up at all times, otherwise some hardware (like
the UFS controller) loses its connection to the rest of the SoC,
resulting in a hang of the platform, accompanied by a spectacular
logspam.

Mark it as keepalive to prevent such cases.
