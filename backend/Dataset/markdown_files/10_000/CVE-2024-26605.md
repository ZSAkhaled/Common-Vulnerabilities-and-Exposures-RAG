PCI/ASPM: Fix deadlock when enabling ASPM

A last minute revert in 6.7-final introduced a potential deadlock when
enabling ASPM during probe of Qualcomm PCIe controllers as reported by
lockdep:

  ============================================
  WARNING: possible recursive locking detected
  6.7.0 #40 Not tainted
  --------------------------------------------
  kworker/u16:5/90 is trying to acquire lock:
  ffffacfa78ced000 (pci_bus_sem){++++}-{3:3}, at: pcie_aspm_pm_state_change+0x58/0xdc

              but task is already holding lock:
  ffffacfa78ced000 (pci_bus_sem){++++}-{3:3}, at: pci_walk_bus+0x34/0xbc

              other info that might help us debug this:
   Possible unsafe locking scenario:

         CPU0
         ----
    lock(pci_bus_sem);
    lock(pci_bus_sem);

               *** DEADLOCK ***

   qcom_pcie_host_post_init_2_7_0+0x28/0x34 [pcie_qcom]

The deadlock can easily be reproduced on machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad
X13s by adding a delay to increase the race window during asynchronous
probe where another thread can take a write lock.

Add a new pci_set_power_state_locked() and associated helper functions that
can be called with the PCI bus semaphore held to avoid taking the read lock
twice.
