# CVE-2024-1069 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Contact Form Entries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file validation on the 'view_page' function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
