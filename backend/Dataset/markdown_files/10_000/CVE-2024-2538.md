# CVE-2024-2538 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_save_permalink' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and above, to modify the permalinks of arbitrary posts.
