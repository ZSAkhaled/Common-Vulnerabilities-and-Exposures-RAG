# CVE-2024-2857 - contact@wpscan.com

The Simple Buttons Creator WordPress plugin through 1.04 does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF in its add button function, allowing unauthenticated users to call them either directly or via CSRF attacks. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also allow them to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins.
