# CVE-2024-21598 - sirt@juniper.net

An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If a BGP update is received over an established BGP session which contains a tunnel encapsulation attribute with a specifically malformed TLV, rpd will crash and restart.
