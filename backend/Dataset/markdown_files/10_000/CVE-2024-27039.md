# CVE-2024-27039 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: hisilicon: hi3559a: Fix an erroneous devm_kfree()

'p_clk' is an array allocated just before the for loop for all clk that
need to be registered.
It is incremented at each loop iteration.

If a clk_register() call fails, 'p_clk' may point to something different
from what should be freed.

The best we can do, is to avoid this wrong release of memory.
