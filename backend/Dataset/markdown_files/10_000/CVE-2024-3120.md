# CVE-2024-3120 - cna@pentraze.com

A stack-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in all versions of sngrep since v1.4.1. The flaw is due to inadequate bounds checking when copying 'Content-Length' and 'Warning' headers into fixed-size buffers in the sip_validate_packet and sip_parse_extra_headers functions within src/sip.c. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted SIPÂ messages.
