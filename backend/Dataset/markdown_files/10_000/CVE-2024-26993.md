# CVE-2024-26993 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()

The sysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference
leak in its error path.  If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then
kn will be NULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection()
routine won't get called (and would only cause an access violation by
trying to dereference kn->parent if it was called).  As a result, the
reference to kobj acquired at the start of the function will never be
released.

Fix the leak by adding an explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.
