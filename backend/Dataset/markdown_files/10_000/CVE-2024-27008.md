# CVE-2024-27008 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: nv04: Fix out of bounds access

When Output Resource (dcb->or) value is assigned in
fabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access to
dac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is
used as index there.
The 'or' argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must be interpreted as a
number of bit to set, not value.

Utilize macros from 'enum nouveau_or' in calls instead of hardcoding.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
