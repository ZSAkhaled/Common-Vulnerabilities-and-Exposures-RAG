# CVE-2024-0679 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The ColorMag theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the plugin_action_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install and activate arbitrary plugins.
