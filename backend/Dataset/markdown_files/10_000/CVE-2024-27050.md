# CVE-2024-27050 - cve@kernel.org

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()

When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf
bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.
This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means
that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller
size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by
libbpf writing out of bounds.

The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the
feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)
macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this
fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()
macro.
