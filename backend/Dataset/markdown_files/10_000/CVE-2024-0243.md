# CVE-2024-0243 - security@huntr.dev

With the following crawler configuration:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup

url = "https://example.com"
loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
    url=url, max_depth=2, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
)
docs = loader.load()
```

An attacker in control of the contents of `https://example.com` could place a malicious HTML file in there with links like "https://example.completely.different/my_file.html" and the crawler would proceed to download that file as well even though `prevent_outside=True`.
