# CVE-2024-2491 - cve-request@wordfence.com

The PowerPack Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the *_html_tag* attribute of multiple widgets in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.17 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
