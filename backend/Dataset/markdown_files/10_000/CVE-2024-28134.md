					An unauthenticated remote attacker can extract a session token with a MitM attack and gain web-based
management access with the privileges of the currently logged in user due to cleartext transmission of sensitive information. No additional user interaction is required. The access is limited as only non-sensitive information can be obtained but the availability can be seriously affected.
